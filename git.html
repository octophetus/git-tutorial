		<h2>How to create a Git Repository for the first time:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Make your desired changes to your HTML/CSS or whatever.</li>
				<li>Right click inside of the folder where your files are located and open a “Git Bash Here”.</li>
				<li>Type <span class="bluetype">git init</span> and press enter.</li>
				<li>Type <span class="bluetype">git add .</span> and press enter. This picks all your files in the repo.</li>
				<li>Type <span class="bluetype">git commit -m "First commit"</span> (including the quotes!) and press enter.</li>
				<li>Go to GitHub’s website and click “Start a Project”.</li>
				<li>Give your repository a name and click “create repository”.</li>
				<li>You now have a repository!  On its main “code” page, copy the full HTTPS link.  It will look something like <span class="italics">"https://github.com/username/reponame.git”</span></li>
				<li>Back in Git Bash type <span class="bluetype">git remote add origin <span class="italics">https://github.com/username/reponame.git</span></span> and hit enter.  That URL should be the same as yours that you just copied.</li>
				<li>Finally, type <span class="bluetype">git push origin master</span> and hit enter.</li>
				<li>If you want your repo to be available online as a website you can view in browser, go to its “settings” tab in GitHub and towards the bottom under “GitHub Pages” you will see “Source”.  Set the “source” to <span class="italics">“master-branch”</span>.  You will then be given a link to where you can view your site.</li>

		<h2>How to get changes made to your online Git Repo onto your local one:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>For example, we will go to our Git Repo on GitHub’s website.</li>
				<li>From its main “code” tab, we should create a README file.  This is a basic description of what your project is all about.  You will find a link to make one at the bottom right-hand side of the "code" tab where it says "Add a README". Write whatever you want as a description and save it by pressing "commit new file".</li>
				<li>Right click inside of the folder where your files are located and open a “Git Bash Here”.</li>
				<li>Type <span class="bluetype">git pull origin master</span> and press enter.</li>
				<p>Simple as that! You should now have the ReadMe file located in your local repo.  This works for any updates.</p>
