		<h2>How to create a Git Repository for the first time:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Make your desired changes to your HTML/CSS or whatever.</li>
			<li>Right click inside of the folder where your files are located and open a “Git Bash Here”.</li>
			<li>Type <span class="bluetype">git init</span> and press enter.</li>
			<li>Type <span class="bluetype">git add .</span> and press enter. This picks all your files in the repo.</li>
			<li>Type <span class="bluetype">git commit -m "First commit"</span> (including the quotes!) and press enter.</li>
			<li>Go to GitHub’s website and click “Start a Project”.</li>
			<li>Give your repository a name and click “create repository”.</li>
			<li>You now have a repository!  On its main “code” page, copy the full HTTPS link.  It will look something like <span class="italics">"https://github.com/username/reponame.git”</span></li>
			<li>Back in Git Bash type <span class="bluetype">git remote add origin <span class="italics">https://github.com/username/reponame.git</span></span> and hit enter.  That URL should be the same as yours that you just copied.</li>
			<li>Finally, type <span class="bluetype">git push origin master</span> and hit enter.</li>
			<li>If you want your repo to be available online as a website you can view in browser, go to its “settings” tab in GitHub and towards the bottom under “GitHub Pages” you will see “Source”.  Set the “source” to <span class="italics">“master-branch”</span>.  You will then be given a link to where you can view your site.</li>
		</ol>

	<div class ="right-flex">
		<h2>How to get changes made to your online Git Repo onto your local one:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>For example, we will go to our Git Repo on GitHub’s website.</li>
			<li>From its main “code” tab, we should create a README file.  This is a basic description of what your project is all about.  You will find a link to make one at the bottom right-hand side of the "code" tab where it says "Add a README". Write whatever you want as a description and save it by pressing "commit new file".</li>
			<li>Right click inside of the folder where your files are located and open a “Git Bash Here”.</li>
			<li>Type <span class="bluetype">git pull origin master</span> and press enter.</li>
			<p>Simple as that! You should now have the ReadMe file located in your local repo.  This works for any updates.</p>

			<li>Type <span class="bluetype">git add .</span> and press enter.</li>

		<h2>How to clone a repository:</h2>
		<p>(Or, how to get a copy of a project located on GitHub onto your own local computer so that you can edit it!)<p>
		<ol>
			<li>Go to the GitHub site of the project you wish to work on.</li>
			<li>Under the repository name, click <span class="italics">Clone or download</span>.</li>
			<li>In the <span class="italics">Clone with HTTPs</span> pop-up section, copy the clone URL for the repository.</li>
			<li>Open gitbash and change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.</li>
			<li>In gitbash type <span class="bluetype">git clone <span class="italics">https://github.com/username/reponame</span></span> (with the link used of course being the one you took from the project's github page) and press enter.</li>

		<h2>How to create a branch on a project Github:</h2>
		<p>Create a branch for a project on GitHub so that you can make your own changes to it and suggest that it be added into the 'Master' branch</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Start by following the steps for how to clone a repository.</li>
			<li>In gitbash type <span class="bluetype">git checkout -b <span class="italics">new-branch-name</span></span></li> and hit enter. The "new-branch-name" is typically relevant to the changes you are making. For example, "new-landing-page" or something like that.
			<li>Now you can go about making the changes you want to the project's HTML, CSS, etc. files</li>
			<li>When you are ready to submit, you do so normally (following the <span class="italics">How to send updates from your local file to your Git Repo online"</span> up until it is time to push. Because it is a branch you need to type: <span class="bluetype">git push origin <span id="italics">new-branch-name</span></span></li></li>. You do not write git push origin master as usual, but instead the 'master' is replace with whatever you have named your branch in step 2.
			<li>Type <span class="bluetype">git push origin master</span></li>
			<li>Check to see that your changes have been made on your GitHub</li>
